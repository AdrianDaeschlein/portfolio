  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <p>
    The paper aims to predict American Airlines' flight arrival delays using two
    primary time series forecasting models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated
    Moving Average) and ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality). The objective is to
    analyze the patterns of delays and build an accurate forecasting model to
    assist airlines in improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer
    satisfaction, and reducing economic losses.

  <h3>Used Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      R Programming Language: Used for the entire data analysis and forecasting
      process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Forecasting Models: ARIMA and ETS models are applied for short-term and
      long-term predictions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Data Manipulation Libraries: Packages like tidyverse, dplyr, and lubridate
      were used for data wrangling.
    </li>
    <li>
      Time Series Tools: Functions from the forecast package, including ACF,
      PACF, and stationarity tests, were employed to analyze and model the time
      series data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Visualization: ggplot2 was used to visualize the time series data and
      model outputs.
    </li>
  </ul>
