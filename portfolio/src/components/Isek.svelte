  <h3>ISEK - AI Calendar</h3>

  <h3>General</h3>
  <p>
    Outside of work, ISEK is by far the most sophistacted project I have been a
    part of. Where most of my project where done in days or maybe weeks, I have
    worked on ISEK for years. It has changed a lot, but I just don't have the
    time to work on it as much as I want to. It is now open source, and
    accessible to everyone.
  </p>

  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <p>
    The goal was to create the smartest calendar on the market, combining todos
    and meetings in one place. <br /><br /> Whenever a meeting was moved, the
    todos would move. Meeting got cancelled? Perfect, now the best time to
    tackle that big todo. Meeting got moved ahead? No time for the big todo, but
    enough to tackle some small ones. <br /><br /> No matter what would happen, the
    calendar would always be up to date.
  </p>

  <h3>Used Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      SvelteKit: Though ISEK initally started as an Angular project, we have
      since pivoted to SvelteKit. It was the first time I had used SvelteKit,
      but it has quickly become my favorite framework, hence why this website is
      built with it as well.
