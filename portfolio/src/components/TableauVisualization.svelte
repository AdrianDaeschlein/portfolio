  <h3>Tableau Visualization of Airbnb Data</h3>

  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <p>
    The goal was to provide Airbnb hosts with an intuitive, data-driven tool to
    improve their listingsâ€™ performance in the competitive Copenhagen market. <br
    /><br /> The dashboard helps hosts make informed decisions on pricing,
    amenities, and guest preferences. Whether a host wants to fine-tune pricing
    or enhance their amenities, this tool guides them through making strategic
    changes to stand out in their neighborhood and attract more bookings.
    <br /><br /> With a focus on key metrics and insights, hosts can continuously
    adjust and optimize their listings to boost profitability and appeal.
